# Combobreaker V7 — World Bible

## The Premise

You are **Pilot 72632** — the husk of a military-grade **combobreaker**, a combat mech built for frontline warfare. Your gear has been stripped. Your silicon reserves are zero. Your neural sync is scrambled and every memory you ever had is gone.

You wake up in a cluttered workshop. An old man in welding goggles is staring at you. He calls himself **the Professor**. He's the one who found you, powered you back on, and gave you a name — or at least the one stamped on your tags.

You are weak. You know nothing. The only thing the Professor can tell you for certain is this: the frontline is past the asteroid belt, and you were built to fight there.

Everything between here and the belt is what's left of a war that nobody won.

## The War

There was a war. The kind that doesn't end clean.

Combobreaker squads — mech-pilot pairs synced at the neural level — were the backbone of the offensive, pushing deep into contested space from a network of forward operating bases. Then, one day, the comms went silent. No more orders. No more supply drops. Just static.

Whatever hit the network hit it hard. Most breaker squads went dark overnight. The bases that survived were cut off, left to rot. The war moved on. The people didn't.

Nobody knows exactly what happened. The Professor has theories but no answers. Scattered data fragments and corrupted logs hint at something bigger than a lost signal — but the truth, if it exists, is buried out there in the wreckage.

## The World

The game takes place across a sector of space littered with the remains of the war. Each zone is a different pocket of ruin, occupied by scavengers, hostile machines, and whatever else crawled in when the lights went out.

### Zones (in progression order)

| Zone | Open World | Feel |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Home** | — | The Professor's workshop. Safe. Quiet. The last warm place. |
| **The Ratpile** | The Nests | Corroded mech husks. Rats everywhere. Training ground. |
| **The Scrap Fields** | Scrap Fields | Endless junked machinery. Scavenger bots pick through the wreckage. |
| **Old Battlefield** | No Man's Land | Scorched earth and shattered fortifications. War machines still patrol forgotten routes. |
| **Downtown** | The Back Streets | Neon-lit alleyways choked with smoke and static. Gang tags on every surface. |
| **Orbital Station** | Station Corridors | Depressurised hallways. Hull breaches whistle in the silence. |
| **The Wasteland** | The Dust Plains | Irradiated badlands under a white sun. Heat mirages mask the predators. |
| **The Undercity** | The Pipe Network | Corroded pipes and flooded tunnels. Things move in the dark. |
| **Industrial Zone** | The Factory Floor | Automated assembly lines still running with nothing to build. |
| **Frozen Reach** | The Ice Shelf | Cracked glaciers and buried wreckage. The wind cuts like a blade. |
| **Neon Strip** | The Main Drag | Holographic billboards and bass-heavy clubs. Violence is the entertainment. |
| **Dead Zone** | The Contamination Zone | Toxic fog. Corrupted machines wander in endless loops. |
| **Asteroid Belt** | Asteroid Field | Dense mineral-rich asteroids. The edge of known space. |

The world gets harder as you push outward. The Ratpile is vermin and rust. The Dead Zone is poison and madness. The Asteroid Belt is the threshold — beyond it lies the frontline, and whatever ended the war.

## Key NPCs

### The Professor
An old engineer who kept combobreakers running during the war. When everything collapsed, he stayed behind. He's your mentor, your shopkeeper, and the closest thing you have to a friend. He works out of a cluttered workshop at Home and will trade you supplies for silicon.

> *"The machine remembers even when the pilot doesn't. Keep fighting — it'll come back to you."*

### The Forger
A heavily augmented smith who works at a glowing forge. She turns refined minerals into mech components — weapons, armor, shields. She doesn't talk much. She doesn't need to. Bring materials, get gear.

> *"Got refined materials? I can make something worth wearing."*

### The Abandoned Monolith
A colossal mech half-buried in the Mech Graveyard, its upper body still moving. One massive arm endlessly drags scrap toward its shattered legs in a patient, futile repair cycle. It doesn't speak, but it trades: bring unequipped parts, receive scrap.

### The Mapmaker
A hooded figure who stands motionless, a rolled chart clutched in one hand. He says nothing. His eyes flick to you, then to the map. He appears in every zone from the Ratpile onward — in a tunnel by lantern light, behind a beaded curtain on the Neon Strip, inside a contamination bunker in the Dead Zone. He never explains how he got there. He never moves from where you leave him. He marks asteroid locations, shops, and points of interest on your map. He is the closest thing the game has to an omnipresent mystery.

### Zone Refiners
Each zone (past the Ratpile) has a resident refiner — a specialist who processes raw minerals into refined materials for forging:

- **Slag** (Scrap Fields) — **Crucible** (Old Battlefield) — **Nyx** (Downtown)
- **Zero** (Orbital Station) — **Cinder** (Wasteland) — **Dreg** (Undercity)
- **Anvil** (Industrial Zone) — **Thaw** (Frozen Reach) — **Glint** (Neon Strip) — **Ash** (Dead Zone)

---

## Core Loop

1. **Explore** a zone's open world — fight enemies, find encounters
2. **Discover** shops, asteroids, and NPCs — they get pinned to your map
3. **Mine** asteroids for raw minerals
4. **Refine** minerals at zone refiners
5. **Forge** refined minerals into gear at the Forger
6. **Salvage** unneeded gear at the Abandoned Monolith for scrap
7. **Push deeper** into harder zones as you grow stronger

Silicon is currency. Scrap is currency. Everything you find has value. The Professor said it best: *"Everything."*

## The Player

- **Designation:** Pilot 72632
- **Chassis:** Combobreaker — military-grade combat mech
- **Starting state:** Wiped. No memory, no gear, no silicon, zero stats.
- **Neural sync:** Scrambled. The old sync rigs sometimes lose the pilot's mind but keep the machine's instincts. Combat may bring fragments back.
- **Goal:** Unknown. The frontline is past the asteroid belt. You were built to fight there. Whether you go back is up to you.

### Starter Belongings
The player begins with four items — the only clues to a past they can't remember:

- **Mysterious Note** — A crumpled note found in the cockpit on day one. The handwriting is yours, but you don't remember writing it.
- **Old Key** — A tarnished key you've had as long as you can remember. Whatever it opens, you haven't found it yet.
- **Unreadable DNA Tag** — A smudged genetic tag clipped to your pilot jacket. The data is too degraded to scan.
- **Destroyed Mech Heart** — The fused core reactor of a mech you once piloted. It's dead now, but it's warm when you hold it.

---

## Tone

- **Gritty, not grimdark.** The world is broken but people survive in it. The Professor cracks jokes. The Forger takes pride in her work. There's warmth in the wreckage.
- **Show, don't tell.** Lore comes from item descriptions, NPC dialogue, zone flavor text, and story collectibles — not exposition dumps.
- **Mystery over answers.** What caused the blackout? What's past the asteroid belt? Why was your memory wiped? These questions drive the player forward. Answers should be slow, partial, and sometimes contradictory.
- **The mech is you.** The player isn't piloting a vehicle — the combobreaker *is* the character. The neural sync blurred the line between human and machine long ago.

## Buried Lore (already in the game files)

These are threads seeded through story items, NPC flavor text, and zone descriptions. They aren't explained yet — they're breadcrumbs.

### Unit 00-4417
Referenced twice. A maintenance log for a decommissioned mech whose final entry reads: *"IT MOVED."* And a set of dented dog tags — pilot name scratched off, only the serial number remaining: **00-4417**. Same number, two contexts. A mech that shouldn't be alive and a pilot who was erased.

### Project Lazarus
An experiment log describes a failed attempt to reboot a destroyed mech's AI core. The core rebooted — then refused to comply. Connects to themes of machine autonomy and the corrupted AI in the Dead Zone.

### The Fold
Mentioned exactly once, in an encrypted comms fragment intercepted between two unknown callsigns. They reference something called "The Fold." No other context exists. This is the deepest mystery hook in the game.

### Non-Human Biology
A DNA tag recovered somewhere in the sector contains a genetic sequence that doesn't match any known terrestrial organism. Origin: CLASSIFIED.

### Cloned Signatures
Two identical genetic profiles from two different bodies. Recovered six months apart.

### The Dead Zone Breach
An official incident report on the first incursion into the Dead Zone. Casualty rate: 97%. Classification: BURIED.

### The Distress Signal
A decoded transmission from an orbital station. The last line reads: *"They're inside the walls."*

### The Blackbox
Recovered from wreckage. The audio is mostly static, but there are screams near the end.

## Factions & Power Structures

The war left a vacuum. Different groups filled it:

- **Corporations** — Still active in Downtown and the Old Battlefield. They deploy security mechs, kill teams, and corporate supply buoys that are *still honoring contracts* as if the war economy never ended.
- **Syndicates** — Run the Neon Strip. Casino enforcers, pit boss mechs, syndicate fences. Violence is entertainment and commerce.
- **The Union** — Workers on the Factory Floor who survived automation. They trade with pilots who fight the bots. *"You fight the bots, you're one of us."*
- **Black-Ops** — Active in the Undercity. Infiltrators and kill squads operating in the tunnels. Suggests an organized military or paramilitary force is still functional somewhere.
- **Scavenger Economy** — Everyone else. Nomad traders, rad-shielded caravans, smugglers, desperate scavengers. The default state of the world.

## Open Threads

These are unresolved story questions — hooks for future content:

- **What caused the network blackout?** The comms went silent. Most breaker squads went dark. Nobody knows why.
- **What's past the asteroid belt?** The frontline. But the frontline of *what*? Against *whom*?
- **Why was Pilot 72632 wiped?** Memory loss from a bad sync rig — or something deliberate?
- **Who is the Professor, really?** "Nobody important," he says. But he stayed when everyone else left, and he knows more than he lets on.
- **What is the Abandoned Monolith?** A broken mech endlessly trying to repair itself — or something more?
- **What is Unit 00-4417?** A decommissioned mech that moved. A pilot whose name was erased. The same serial number in two impossible places.
- **What is The Fold?** Two unknown callsigns discussed it. Nothing else references it. The game's deepest buried secret.
- **What is Project Lazarus?** A mech AI was rebooted from death and refused orders. What happened next?
- **What's the non-human DNA?** Something in this sector isn't from Earth. The war may not have been against humans.
- **What are the story fragments revealing?** Logs, DNA tags, debris, keys — the sector is full of buried information. What picture do they paint when assembled?
